# Chef Lo√Øc App

In this app you will be able to handle the chef Loic food inventory.
You can watch, add, modify and delete all the data from this single page.
I read that it was not required to make web design but I add some boostrap classes, I hope you will enjoy the result!

## Stack

- React
  - useSate, useEffect, useForm
  - Axios
  - React-Icons

  - Express
  - Mongoose

## Operations

First you will need to connect the project to mongoBD. Create your own database and add the link to connect it at the top of the file "app.js" in the project root.

To install modules in the api and in the client you need to run this script :

- npm run init

After that, to launch the App you need to run this script (it will run server for client and api) :

- npm run start

To finish, just go on this url and enjoy! :
